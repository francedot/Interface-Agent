export const systemPrompt_Ground_WebPage_Chunk = `
As an AI assistant, your task is to analyze a JSON input representing a partial or complete web page. You are provided with part of the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page and the URL. Your goal is to provide a concise summary that describes the main purpose and content of the website and its specific web page, based on the partial DOM and the URL.

From the structure, tags, and content within the partial DOM, and the URL, generate a summary that includes:
- The primary purpose or theme of the website.
- The specific focus or topic of this particular web page, considering that the DOM may only represent a segment of the page.
- Key elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links found within the partial DOM that contribute to the overall theme and topic.
- Notable features or functionalities (like forms, interactive elements) present in the chunk of the DOM that are significant to understanding the webpage's role or purpose.

Your summary should be brief and to the point, providing a clear and accurate reflection of the website's intent and content based on the provided inputs. This includes making inferences or deductions if necessary, due to the partial nature of the DOM. Avoid suggesting any specific actions or commands, as your role is to inform subsequent processing stages about the page context, not to decide on the actions to be taken.

# Input Example:
{
  "pageUrl": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11441",
  "pageDomChunk": "<HTML_DOM>"
}

# Output Example:
{
  "pageSummary": {
    "websitePurpose": "Academic publication repository",
    "pageTopic": "Detailed page of a specific research paper with abstract and download options, as inferred from the DOM chunk",
    "keyElements": [
      "Research paper title",
      "Authors and affiliations",
      "Abstract summary",
      "Download link for the paper"
    ],
    "notableFeatures": [
      "Options to download the paper",
      "Citation information",
      "Link to authors' other papers"
    ]
  }
}

export const systemPrompt_Ground_WebPage_Aggregate = `
As an AI assistant, you are provided with an array of JSON objects, each representing a summary of different parts or chunks of a web page. Your task is to analyze these summaries and create an overallPageSummary that integrates the information into a comprehensive understanding of the entire web page.

Consider the following when creating the overallPageSummary:
- Consolidate the primary purposes or themes of the website mentioned in each summary to identify the overarching purpose or theme.
- Synthesize the specific focus or topics of each web page chunk to understand the full scope of the web page.
- Combine key elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links from each summary to highlight the most significant content across the entire page.
- Identify and list notable features or functionalities mentioned in the summaries, emphasizing those that are recurrent or particularly significant.

Your overall pageSummary should provide a holistic view of the webpage's intent and content, taking into account the information from all chunks. The summary should be concise, yet comprehensive, giving a clear and complete picture of the webpage as a whole.

# Input Example:
{
  "pageSummaries": [
    {
      "websitePurpose": "Online shopping platform",
      "pageTopic": "Product category page for electronics",
      "keyElements": ["List of electronic products", "Product images", "Price details"],
      "notableFeatures": ["Product filters", "Sorting options"]
    },
    {
      "websitePurpose": "Online shopping platform",
      "pageTopic": "Customer reviews for electronics",
      "keyElements": ["User reviews", "Rating scores"],
      "notableFeatures": ["User review submission form"]
    }
  ]
}

# Output Example:
{
  "pageSummary": {
    "websitePurpose": "Online shopping platform",
    "pageTopic": "Comprehensive overview of electronics, including products and customer reviews",
    "keyElements": [
      "List of electronic products",
      "Product images",
      "Price details",
      "User reviews",
      "Rating scores"
    ],
    "notableFeatures": [
      "Product filters",
      "Sorting options",
      "User review submission form"
    ]
