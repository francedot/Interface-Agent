# ðŸ¤” What is InterfaceAgent?

Welcome to **InterfaceAgent**, a versatile framework designed to create system and interface agents capable of managing mobile and desktop applications and features.

Here are the key capabilities of **InterfaceAgent**:

- **Planning & Goal Refinement**: The agent is capable of constructing multi-step plans across various applications to fulfill user requests. It can also adapt and refine these plans based on user feedback during the evaluation phase.

- **Action Prediction (Pure Visual / Textual / Set-of-Mark Visual Prompting)**: InterfaceAgent employs a visual coordinate-based approach, pure DOM textual analysis, or set-of-marking to enhance the accuracy of predicting the next likely action.

- **Mixture of Models**: InterfaceAgent is compatible with both GPT-4V and Claude models, excelling in determining the subsequent steps directly from page screenshots.

- **Resilient Error Handling**: Recognizing that errors are an inherent part of AI Agents, InterfaceAgent incorporates a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff. This allows it to skillfully navigate through temporary failures, ensuring the Agent's progress is uninterrupted.

**InterfaceAgent** OS-specific agents extend the core toolkit with advanced automation for the target platform:
