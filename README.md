# ðŸ¤” What is OSAgent?

Welcome to **OSAgent** (/nÃ¦v eÉª aÉª É¡aÉªd/), an extensible multi-modal agentic framework designed to fulfill plans and user queries by tapping into the mobile and desktop ecosystem of apps available. Here's how OSAgent stands out:

- **Visual Task Detection:** Compatible with GPT-4V and many more vision models, OSAgent excels at identifying the next steps directly from page screenshots.

- **Advanced Code Selectors:** Recognizing that visual elements and their positions sometimes fall short, OSAgent employs grounding techniques for both XML and HTML, allowing for precise matching with the most relevant selectors, tailored to the specific action required.

- **Action-Oriented Execution:** At its core, OSAgent features an action-based framework using a JSON schema and reproducible outputs.

- **Resilient Error Handling:** Understanding that errors are part of AI Agents, OSAgent features a built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff, adeptly navigating through transient failures to ensure the Agent can move forward.

**OSAgent Agents** extend the core toolkit with advanced automation solutions:
