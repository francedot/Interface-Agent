# ðŸ¤” What is InterfaceAgent?

Welcome to **InterfaceAgent**, a multi-modal agentic framework to build system and interface agent capable of controlling mobile and desktop features and apps.

Here are **InterfaceAgent** main capabilities:

- **Planning & Goal Refinement**: the agent can build multi-steps plan across apps to fullfill user requests, and reiterate based on user feedbacks during the evaluation phase. 

- **Action Prediction (Pure Visual / Textual / Set-of-Mark Visual Prompting)**: Use visual coordinate-based approach, pure DOM textual, or set-of-marking for increased accuracy in determining the next probable action.

- **Mixture of Models:** Compatible with GPT-4V and Claude models, InterfaceAgent excels at identifying the next steps directly from page screenshots.

- **Resilient Error Handling:** Understanding that errors are part of AI Agents, InterfaceAgent features a built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff, adeptly navigating through transient failures to ensure the Agent can move forward.


**InterfaceAgent** OS specific agents extend the core toolkit with advanced automation for the target platform:
